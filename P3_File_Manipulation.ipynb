    "The `cPickle` library uses handles to the files, which is similar to the python way of dealing with files (manually opening and closing). Here in this point we show yet another altenative to carry out this task in a safe way. As we are not going to use the file further than in the specific save and load functions, we can pass the constructor of the handle (`open(fname, 'r')`) directly as a function argument, and therefore, it will end together with the function. If the handle is declared beforehand, it will not end together with the function and has to be explicitly closed (which is not necessarily a good practice). Therefore, we can also use a similar syntax as we did in the begging of the session as:\n"
