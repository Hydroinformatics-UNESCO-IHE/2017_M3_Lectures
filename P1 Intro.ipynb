    "# Part I: PYTHON Essentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was developed by the Dutch programmer Guido Van Rossum, who named the language after a BBC comedy series from the seventies \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". The easy-to-use and nearly no prerequisite for programming knowledge made it widely accepted by the scientific community. Nowadays, PYTHON has become one of the most powerful tools favoured by many scientists, researchers and engineers. The large community of PYTHON developers and the free, opened nature of the language, adds to its intuitive language features and user-friendly GUI endless possibilities, from fast prototyping to complex applications. It is rather safely to say that most engineering graduates have learned PYTHON during their university stay. So it would be more convenient for you in your research or other engineering career line if you have obtained the knowledge of using PYTHON and programming with it. \n",

You can create and access subfolders in this window, rename files, etc. You can also navigate to other places if you like.

People experienced with Matlab can think about the File explorer as the Matlab’s Current Folder.\n",

The variable type, its size and value are also shown there. You may even produce plots directly from the variable, as we will discuss later. People experienced with Matlab can think about the File explorer as the Matlab’s Workspace\n",
